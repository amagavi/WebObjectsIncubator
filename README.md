WebObjectsIncubator
===================

Some *experimental* reusable Wonder frameworks, meaning that they usually depend on *both* [Project Wonder](https://github.com/projectwonder) and [WebObjects 5.4.3](http://www.wocommunity.org/). Projects in here are _works in progress_, and should be viewed as such. The idea is that if one gets completed and it deemed useful and good enough for Wonder, it may move to Wonder

There is no guarantees that future changes to these projects will not break API, so if you are going to use this source in some important project, feel free to fork it.
